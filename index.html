        <p class="lead mb-4">Iâ€™m a Political Science student at the University of California, Riverside, set to graduate in June 2025 with a Bachelor of Arts. My focus is on political economy and economic development, specifically on the challenges and strategies shaping globalization, migration, and policy impacts. Through courses like Globalization and Underdevelopment and Politics and Economic Policy, I have developed a deep understanding of how policies influence economic growth and social change on both local and international levels.
        

Currently, Iâ€™m engaged in research through UC Riversideâ€™s Honors Program, where my project centers on economic development in developing nations. Since January 2023, I have been building essential research skills, from conducting comprehensive literature reviews to synthesizing findings and developing focused research goals. Presenting my capstone idea to fellow students and professors was a rewarding opportunity to communicate complex ideas, and working closely with a team of peers and faculty has highlighted the importance of collaboration in academic research.

Before transferring to UCR, I was actively involved at Riverside City College, where I served in Student Government as a dedicated Student Event Coordinator. In this role, I successfully planned and organized various campus events and effectively represented student concerns to the administration. This invaluable experience not only strengthened my organizational and communication skills but also deepened my commitment to community-building and impactful leadership.

In addition to my academic and leadership work, I have gained practical experience as a self-employed administrative worker since early 2023. Managing tasks like scheduling, document preparation, and file organization has sharpened my administrative abilities. I have also completed self-guided training in Excel Desktop and Strategic Negotiation through LinkedIn Learning, equipping me with the skills needed to support office operations more effectively.
Making a difference beyond academics is a priority for me. As a mentor with the Mentor Collective, I take pride in guiding and supporting incoming students as they navigate their academic journeys and adjust to college life. This experience not only allows me to give back to the community but also deepens my understanding of the challenges faced by new students. Sharing insights and strategies has proven rewarding, as it strengthens my commitment to fostering a supportive environment where everyone can thrive.
Engaging with peers in meaningful ways has been pivotal in my journey. Being a member of the Pi Sigma Alpha fraternity has enriched my college experience and expanded my network within the political science field. Through shared experiences and diverse perspectives, I have gained invaluable insights that inform my understanding of complex issues. These experiences reinforce the value of collaboration and inspire me to make a meaningful impact in the world.
Fluent in English and Spanish, I engage with diverse communities, and Iâ€™m proficient in Google Docs and Microsoft Office Suite, making me well-prepared for todayâ€™s digital workplace. As I advance in my studies, my goal is to combine my academic background with practical skills to pursue a career in economic strategy and development consulting, particularly in addressing the unique challenges faced by developing nations.
